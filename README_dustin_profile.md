# 👋 Hi, I’m Dustin Trembath

🔧 I’m a lifelong learner, former customer success rockstar, and aspiring IT wizard currently leveling up through self-driven projects and certifications.

🖥️ I built my personal site from scratch using Linux, Git, Neovim, and GitHub Pages:  
➡️ [Visit my site](https://dtremb327.github.io/dustin-website)

---

## 🌱 What I'm Learning Now

- Terminal fluency with Linux (WSL + native)
- Neovim for development
- HTML/CSS fundamentals
- GitHub project workflows

---

## 🧰 Projects & Proof of Growth

- **[Personal Website](https://github.com/dtremb327/dustin-website)**  
  Live portfolio, storytelling, embedded resume, and contact form.

- Bash scripts and Markdown docs (coming soon!)

---

## 🎯 Goals

- Land an entry-level IT support role at a mission-driven org
- Keep exploring creative ways to make tech helpful *and human*

---

## 🎧 Currently vibing with:
- 🐸 Frog memes
- ✨ Learning how to break things on purpose (safely)
- 🔌 Wiring up my brain to Git

---

## 📟 My vibe:
`Terminal tinkerer` + `Customer whisperer` + `Wholesome chaos`

> “Documentation is just storytelling with a keyboard.”  
> — some wise nerd, probably
